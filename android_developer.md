Android developer
====

We are looking for a developer to join our mobile team to ship our coming Android mobile applications.

Our application has already established itself as one of the best health mobile app in the Nordics and other European countries, and we are now making it faster, more reliable. Our next version has a completely reworked UX and will be introducing smarter features.

Tech-wise, we expect you to have developed for several mobile and software platforms, have experience with TDD, error handling and reporting. You have worked with data-intensive applications and know how to optimize your data types and network access in all situations. Our new interfaces are more demanding graphically and you should have experience with canvas and OpenGL.


   * You have worked on multiple consumer mobile/desktop applications/games
   * You are interested in data driven applications
   * You want to work with Android newest and older devices
   * You have or want experience in a fast growing startup
   * You love building products and work for millions of users
   * You like software design patterns, interaction design and (bonus) mobile game development
